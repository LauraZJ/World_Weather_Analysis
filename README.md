# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use python, APIs, and gmaps to obtain lattitude and longitude of various locations, weather data for those locations and to create maps.  Also, we used these methods to plan out a vacation map and itinerary.  Two features added to the maps are: location markers and information markers that includes the hotel information, city name, county code, weather description and max temps.

### Notes to reviewer:
1. I included max temps in the marker in the third deliverable because the starter code stated to include it.  However, the module submission guidelines stated that the marker should include the hotel name, but not the max temps.  I'm just covering all bases by including both.
2. I also included another image in the folder for the third deliverable.  My locations mapped didn't allow for clear image of the locations and markers so I zoomed in so you could see better.  Please disregard if not needed.
